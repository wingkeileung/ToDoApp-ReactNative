# ToDoApp-ReactNative
To-do List app with ReactNative & Firebase

Goal:
To continue to learn and play with the basics of React Native. By no mean this is a fancy app as 
it will render entered items into cards, can be removed by the "done" button.

Dependency:
- Moment (for rendering time/date)
- React Native
- React
- Firebase
